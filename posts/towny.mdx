<Note emoji="ðŸ‘‹">Hi, this guide is to help with understanding the basics: Towny is a plugin that allows players to create and join towns, and claim land within those towns. Each town has a mayor who is responsible for managing the town and its members.</Note>

    1. GUI Menu: Before going further, note that there is a command in-game that brings up a graphical menu with all these commands built in, try it out using "/towny menu".

    2. Joining a town: To join a town, you can use the command "/town join [town name]". If you would like to start your own town, you can use the command "/town new [town name]" and become the mayor of your own town.

    3. Claiming land: To claim land for your town, you will need to be the mayor or a resident of the town. To claim land, use the command "/town claim". The amount of land you can claim will depend on the size of your town and the town's finances.

    4. Managing residents: As the mayor of a town, you can invite other players to join your town using the command "/town add [playername]". You can also remove residents from your town using the command "/town remove [playername]". To promote a resident to an assistant mayor, use the command "/town rank add [playername] assistant". To see a list of all the residents in your town, use the command "/town residents".

    5. Managing plots: Each piece of land within a town is called a plot. As the mayor of a town, you can assign plots to residents using the command "/plot assign [playername]". You can also set the permissions for a plot using the command "/plot set [perm] [true/false]", where [perm] can be any of the following: build, destroy, switch, itemuse, and mobspawn. To see a list of all the plots in your town, use the command "/plot list".

    6. Taxes: Each town must pay taxes to maintain its claims. The amount of taxes owed can be seen using the command "/town". The mayor can also set the tax rate for the town using the command "/town set taxes [amount]". To see the amount of money your town has, use the command "/town deposit".

    7. War and peace: In Towny, towns can declare war on each other. To declare war, use the command "/town war [town name]". To make peace, use the command "/town peace [town name]".

    8. Nation: If you have a town, you can join or create a nation by using the command "/nation new [nation name]" or "/nation join [nation name]". As the leader of a nation, you can invite towns to join your nation using the command "/nation add [town name]".

    9. Chat: To talk to other players in your town, use the command "/t [message]". To talk to players in your nation, use the command "/n [message]".

    10. Plot border: To see the borders of your plots, use the command "/plot toggle".

    11. Plot ownership: To see who owns a plot, you can use the command "/plot info".

    12. Plot clearing: To clear the contents of a plot, you can use the command "/plot clear".

    13. Town information: To see information about your town, use the command "/town".

    14. Nation information: To see information about your nation, use the command "/nation".

    15. Upkeep: To see how much it costs to maintain your town, use the command "/town upkeep".

    16. Teleportation: To teleport to your town, use the command "/town spawn". To teleport to another player's town, use the command "/town spawn [town name]".

    17. Town listings: To see a list of all the towns on the server, use the command "/town list". To see a list of all the nations on the server, use the command "/nation list".

    18. Ranking: To see a list of the top 10 towns and nations by ranking, use the command "/town top" or "/nation top".

    19. Town map: To see a map of all the towns and nations on the server, use the command "/town map".

    20. Reset: To reset your town or nation, use the command "/town delete" or "/nation delete". This will erase all the data and information about your town or nation.

<Note>With these commands, you should be able to navigate and participate in the world of Towny as a beginner.</Note>

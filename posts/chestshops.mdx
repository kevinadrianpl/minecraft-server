### Creating a Shop with ChestShop Plugin

1. **Placing the Chest and Sign**
   - Place a chest on the ground where you want your shop.
   - Put a sign one block away from the chest (for example, above it but it can also work by placing it directly on the chest).

2. **Formatting the Sign**
   - **Line 1**: Leave this line empty; your name will automatically fill in.
   - **Line 2**: Enter the amount of items to buy or sell (e.g., `64` for a full stack).
   - **Line 3**: Specify the buy and sell prices using the format `B buy_price:S sell_price`.
     - Example: `B 10:S 5` means buying at 10 units and selling at 5 units.
   - **Line 4**: Write `?` to auto-fill the item from the chest or write the item's ID/name.
     - Optionally, write the item's name directly on this line. You can find the name by using `/iteminfo` while holding the item.

### Example Shop Setup

- **Sign Text Example**:
  - **Line 1**: (left blank)
  - **Line 2**: `64`
  - **Line 3**: `B 10:S 5`
  - **Line 4**: `?` or the item name (e.g., "Diamonds or Iron_Ingot")

### Resulting Shop:

A player can buy 64 diamonds or 64 Iron Ingots for 10 units and sell them back for 5 units from DirewolF_ZA's shop (DirewolF_ZA created this shop).

### Using the Shop

- **Buying**: Right-click the sign to buy items.
- **Selling**: Left-click the sign to sell items.

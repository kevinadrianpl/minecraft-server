## Creating a Player Warp

Creating a player warp is simple. Stand in the desired location for your warp while looking in the direction you want others players to face. 
Take note, warps can only be set in the Towny world since all other worlds get reset eventually. 

Once in the right spot, run the command /pwarp set [name] where [name] is replaced by one-word without spaces. This name must be unique, must 
be less than 30 characters, must be only A-Z characters, and must not be a vulgar name. Do know that the capitalization will matter as that's what gets displayed in the 
warps listing menu. After you've chosen your name, a message will appear in chat asking you to confirm the creation. 

Please notice that creating a warp does cost money, so make sure you've got enough. Once everything is confirmed, the warp is now created and players can warp to it.


## Using other's Player Warps

There are two ways you can go to other player's warps. The first and easy way is to use the warp listing menu with the command /pwarp. 

This will open a GUI of all the warps available. The other way is to know the name of the warp and use the command /pwarp [name] where [name] is replaced by the one-word
name for the warp (ex: /pwarp endfarm). Either of these two methods will then begin a teleport warmup, which after a second will bring you to the warp destination. 

Once you've warped to the warp, consider giving that warp a positive rating in the GUI.


## Customizing a Player Warp

Once you've created your warp, you can now customize it. Currently, there are two customization options: a description and an icon. The description will appear when 
hovering over your warp inside the warp listing menu. 

Do this by running the command /pwarp desc [name] [desc] where [name] is replaced by the one-word name for your 
warp and [desc] is a multi-worded description of up to 150 characters. The description cannot contain any & characters as those signify color. 

The other customizable option are icons. Icons are what your warp will appear as inside the warp listing menu. By default, a warp will look like your player's head. 

Do this by running the command /pwarp icon [name] where [name] is replaced by the one-word name for your warp. A GUI will then appear where you can select an icon for 
your warp.
